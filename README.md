# hello-world
just another repository

Here I am!

Firstly, I have no idea how to be a qualified programmer.
Then I just hear the GitHub from my roommate, who he is much better than me ( Of course in the computer field! Well, I can play basketball all day...)
Last but not least, my ultimate goal is to enter the Apple. Apparently, there is a long long way to go!
Keeping trying!
